# 1: single line comments
# print("Hello,World")
print('single line comment')
# 2: multi line comments can be applied through add '#' at starting of each line
# print('chandra')
# print("sekhar")
# print('''chandrasekhar''')
# 3: Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
# you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
'''This is multiline comment'''
print('multi line comments')
